# Week 5: XR Development Fundamentals

Week 5 introduces XR (Extended Reality) development using Unity and Meta's Quest platform. This week focuses on setting up XR projects, configuring development environments, and implementing basic XR interactions using Meta's Building Blocks system.

## Learning Progression

1. **XR Project Setup** - Configure Unity for Meta Quest 2/3 development
2. **Meta SDK Integration** - Install and configure Meta's All-in-One SDK
3. **Simulator Development** - Test XR projects using Unity's XR Simulator
4. **Building Blocks** - Implement pre-built XR interaction systems
5. **Headset Deployment** - Build and test projects on physical Quest devices
