# Week 2: Unity Fundamentals

Week 2 introduces students to Unity's core concepts through hands-on activities that build progressively from basic scene creation to interactive game mechanics.

## Learning Progression

1. **Scene Building** - Learn Unity's interface and create environments
2. **Object Movement** - Understand Transform components and basic scripting
3. **Input Systems** - Create player-controlled movement
4. **Collision Detection** - Build interactive game systems

## Activities

All activities are located in the `Week 02/` directory:

- **[Activity 1](Activity%201%20-%20Build%20A%20Scene.md)** - Build A Scene
  - Unity interface and best practices
  - Creating scenes from primitive objects
  - Asset organization and hierarchy management

- **[Activity 2a](Activity%202a%20-%20Rotate%20an%20Object.md)** - Rotate an Object
  - Basic C# scripting in Unity
  - Transform component manipulation
  - Understanding Update() and Time.deltaTime

- **[Activity 2b](Activity%202b%20-%20Move%20and%20Object.md)** - Move an Object
  - Object translation and movement
  - Vector3 and direction concepts
  - Combining rotation and movement

- **[Activity 3](Activity%203%20-%20Input%20Movement.md)** - Input Movement
  - Unity's Input system
  - Player-controlled movement
  - WASD and arrow key controls

- **[Activity 4](Activity%204%20-%20Object%20Interactions.md)** - Object Interactions
  - Collision detection systems
  - Trigger colliders and event handling
  - Interactive game mechanics

## C# Scripts

The following Unity-compatible C# scripts are included in the `Scripts/` directory:

- **[Rotator.cs](Scripts/Rotator.cs)** - Implements continuous object rotation
- **[PlayerMovement.cs](Scripts/PlayerMovement.cs)** - Handles keyboard input for player movement
- **[CollisionHandler.cs](Scripts/CollisionHandler.cs)** - Manages collision detection and object interaction

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
2. **Setup**: Open Unity and create a new 3D project
3. **Activities**: Follow the activities in order for best learning progression
4. **Extensions**: Each activity includes optional extension challenges
