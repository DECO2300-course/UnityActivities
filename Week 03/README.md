# Week 3: Advanced Unity Concepts

Week 3 builds upon the fundamentals learned in Week 2, introducing more advanced Unity concepts including debugging, UI development, mathematical operations, raycasting, and XR preparation.

## Learning Progression

1. **Editor Debugging** - Learn Unity's debugging tools and console output
2. **UI Development** - Create TextMeshPro UI elements and connect them to scripts
3. **Mathematical Operations** - Master vector operations, distance calculations, and angle measurements
4. **Raycasting** - Implement line-of-sight detection and interactive targeting systems
5. **XR Preparation** - Set up Unity for Meta Quest 2/3 XR development [Optional]
