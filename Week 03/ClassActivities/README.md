# Week 3: Class Activities

This folder contains additional materials and examples used during class sessions that complement the main Week 3 activities.

This contribution comes from Gita:

> Hi there, a lot of peeps from my studio session were having a hard time reimagining XR modalities in their prototypes as keyboard/mouse interactions in unity for the horizontal prototype. Was playing around with unity and got chatgpt to generate this script for me.
> 
> During runtime, it allows the user to interact with the objects directly with their mouse using raycasting, and also right-click drag lets you look around the scene, wasd for movement and space for up, left-ctrl for down

## Materials

**[KeyboardMovement+MouseInteractor.cs](KeyboardMovement+MouseInteractor.cs)** - Advanced movement and interaction system with WASD movement, mouse look, and 3D object grabbing.
