# Week 4: Interactive Object Systems

Week 4 introduces students to advanced interaction systems including proximity-based reactions, object selection, and physics-based object manipulation. This week builds upon the fundamentals learned in previous weeks and introduces more complex game mechanics.

## Learning Progression

1. **Proximity Reactions** - Learn proximity detection and object response systems
2. **Object Selection** - Implement object selection and interaction mechanics
3. **Physics Manipulation** - Master object grabbing, throwing, and physics interactions
4. **Advanced Scripting** - Combine multiple systems for complex gameplay mechanics

## Activities

All activities are located in the `Week 04/` directory:

- **[Activity 1](Activity%201%20-%20Proximity%20Reactions.md)** - Proximity-Based Object Reactions
  - Proximity detection using Vector3.Distance
  - Object highlighting and visual feedback systems
  - Movement, sound, and visual effects extensions
  - Performance-optimized proximity detection

- **[Activity 2](Activity%202%20-%20Object%20Selection%20and%20Throwing.md)** - Object Selection and Throwing
  - Object selection and interaction mechanics
  - Physics-based object manipulation
  - Object parenting and transform management
  - Advanced input handling and state management

## C# Scripts

The following Unity-compatible C# scripts are included in the `scripts/` directory:

- **[ProximityHighlighter.cs](scripts/ProximityHighlighter.cs)** - Basic proximity highlighting system
- **[ProximityMover.cs](scripts/ProximityMover.cs)** - Movement-based proximity reactions
- **[ProximitySound.cs](scripts/ProximitySound.cs)** - Audio feedback for proximity changes
- **[ProximityEffects.cs](scripts/ProximityEffects.cs)** - Visual effects and transformations
- **[Grabbable.cs](scripts/Grabbable.cs)** - Object interaction and physics setup
- **[PlayerGrabber.cs](scripts/PlayerGrabber.cs)** - Basic object grabbing system
- **[PlayerGrabberRaycast.cs](scripts/PlayerGrabberRaycast.cs)** - Raycast-based object selection
- **[PlayerGrabberVelocity.cs](scripts/PlayerGrabberVelocity.cs)** - Velocity-based throwing mechanics
- **[SimpleWASD.cs](scripts/SimpleWASD.cs)** - Player movement and rotation controls
